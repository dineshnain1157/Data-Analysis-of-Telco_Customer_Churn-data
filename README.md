# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis – End-to-End Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview
This project performs an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning
analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced
passenger survival during the disaster.

The focus of this project is not only predictive modeling, but also
**data-driven storytelling and decision-making**, making it suitable for
open-source and research-oriented programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC).

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant features
- Handled missing values using statistical methods
- Encoded categorical variables
- Prepared a clean dataset for analysis

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Survival analysis by gender, class, age, and fare
- Feature relationships visualized with plots
- Identification of high-risk passenger groups

### 3️⃣ Modeling & Prediction
- Logistic Regression used as a baseline model
- Random Forest used to capture non-linear patterns
- Model comparison based on accuracy
- Feature importance analysis for interpretability

### 4️⃣ Business Insights & Strategy
- Identified high-risk and low-risk passenger profiles
- Highlighted socio-economic influence on survival
- Proposed data-driven safety and evacuation strategies

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Females and first-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates
- Fare and socio-economic status strongly influenced survival
- Small family groups survived more than solo or large groups
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression

## 🧠 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can be used
to extract meaningful insights from historical data and support
decision-making in critical scenarios.

The structured workflow, clean pipeline, and interpretability make this
project suitable for open-source contributions and GSoC-style research work.
