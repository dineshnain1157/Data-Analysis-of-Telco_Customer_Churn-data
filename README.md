# Data-Analysis-of-Telco_Customer_Churn-data
"Performed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, customer segmentation, churn prediction (Logistic Regression &amp; Random Forest), and calculated customer lifetime value (LTV) using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. Generated insights, visualizations, and retention strategies to support data-driven decision-making."

Project Title: Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

This project aims to analyze customer churn within a telecommunications company and create predictive models to identify customers at risk of leaving. The primary objective is to offer practical insights and recommendations to reduce churn and enhance customer retention.  
You are required to complete four out of the six available tasks to finish the project.  
Tasks

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Description: This task involves handling missing data and converting categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding.  

Skills: Data cleaning, handling missing data, and encoding categorical variables.  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Description: This task requires you to calculate and visualize the churn rate, explore customer demographics, analyze customer tenure, and investigate the relationship between churn and different contract types or payment methods.  

Skills: Statistical analysis, data visualization, and the ability to interpret data patterns.  

3. Customer Segmentation
Description: This task involves segmenting customers based on their tenure, monthly charges, and contract type, then analyzing the churn rates across these segments.  

Skills: Customer segmentation methods (e.g., RFM analysis) and data interpretation.  

4. Churn Prediction Model
Description: You will develop a churn prediction model using machine learning algorithms like logistic regression. The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.  

Skills: Machine learning, programming (Python or R), and knowledge of evaluation metrics.  

5. Customer Retention Strategies
Description: The goal is to propose data-driven strategies to reduce churn by identifying key factors that influence it and suggesting actionable steps. You will also need to calculate the customer lifetime value (LTV) and identify high-value customers who are at risk of churning.  

Skills: Business acumen, knowledge of customer retention strategies, and proficiency in tools for customer segmentation and analysis.  

6. Visualizations
Description: This task focuses on creating various visualizations such as box plots, violin plots, and pair plots to gain deeper insights from the data.  

Skills: Data visualization using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Tableau, and the ability to convey complex information visually.
